Design Notes
===============================

The order of the codes really reflects the bottom up approach. We design the stats collection class (TopVolumeRanks) that takes care of top N
symbols then we design the smallest unit SimpleOrder, followed by SimpleBookOrder(container for SimpleOrder), Book (container for per symbol SimpleBookOrder),
utility parser functions and then PitchMessageHandler.

Solution Notes
===============================

1. The solution is focused on logical seperation of concern, correctness and performance.
but to keep it simple, it is not focused on physical code layout, so the code is in the
same translation unit, saving me the time to have to worry about linking.

2. the solution is not designed for thread safety for simplicity.


3. the solution strives for self explained code, so each class definition is immediately followed by
   unit test, which can help with code review (part of the reason it was all put in file)



Build Notes
===============================

The solution builds with cmake

>cmake .
>make


the unittest part of the solution bulds with gtest, thus requires gtest lib to be installed.
this can be done either with apt install, or you can build directly from source


https://github.com/google/googletest


which is actually quite easy

You will have to change the CMakeLists.txt to make this compile thou


to run the program, do

time ./main < ./pitch_sample_data


*Note*
If for any reason, you just don't want to deal with cmake or unittest, you can always do
g++ -g -Wall -O3 --std=c++14 ./main.cpp -o ./main

tested on ubuntu 18.04 with g++ 7.3.0
