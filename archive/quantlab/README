Build Notes
===============================

The solution builds with cmake

>cmake .
>make


the unittest part of the solution bulds with gtest, thus requires gtest lib to be installed.
this can be done either with apt install, or you can build directly from source


https://github.com/google/googletest


which is actually quite easy

You will have to change the CMakeLists.txt to make this compile thou


to run the program, do

time ./main < ./input.csv


*Note*
if you don't want to deal with cmake or unittest, you can always do
g++ -g -Wall -O3 --std=c++14 ./main.cpp -o ./main
